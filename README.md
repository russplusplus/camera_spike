## React Native Camera Spike

This app was made for a weekend assignment asking us to create a simple application that explores the use of a single feature of our solo projects. My solo project relies heavily on the mobile device camera, so I looked into how to use the camera within a React Native app.

# Description

The app is a simple camera, that can take photos with either the front or rear camera, display the new photos and store them to the device. The user can press a button on screen to view the images folder where they are saved.

# Technologies Used

This app is built in React Native in an Expo environment. It uses Permissions from Expo to request Camera access, Camera from Expo to use the device camera, and icons from FontAwesome, Ionicons, and MaterialCommunityIcons.
